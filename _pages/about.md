I am Jason Kong, a 2nd-year undergrad student in the CSE department at UC San Diego, working under the guidance of Professor. Tajana Rosing. My research focuses on hardware-software co-design and LLM systems. 

**Current Research**
======
I am currently engaged in cutting-edge research in hyper-dimensional computing (HDC), processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, and compression methods for large language models (LLMs), under the supervision of [Professor Tajana Šimunić Rosing](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/) at the [PRISM center](https://prism.ucsd.edu/) and [SeeLab](http://varys.ucsd.edu/).

**Projects and Publications**
======
- **Hardware and Sofware Co-Design for HDC and PIM Architectures:**
  - Projects: MicroHD journal extension paper
  - 

- **TrimNet LLM Compression deployment in Edge Devices:**
  - Developing optimized Large Language Models (LLMs) for deployment on edge devices using TrimNet and Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ). Implementing task-specific LLM agents coordinated by a central control agent to enhance performance and resource utilization in real-time applications like video streaming and memory management on devices such as Raspberry Pi and Nvidia Jetson.
